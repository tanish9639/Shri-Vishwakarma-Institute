  <p class="steno">Stenography is also called shorthand. A systematic criteria for rapid hand writing that uses abbreviations and symbols for, words, phrases or letters. The most popular modern systems are Pitmanâ€™s shorthand, Speed writing and Greg .
    Behalf of being known as the stenography , shorthand is sometimes called close, little, or narrow writing(tachygraphy) and short writing (brachygraphy). Because steno can be  written very rapidly, the writer is able to record the legislative bodies proceedings . The law of courts, in business or dictation will be correspondence. In additional, shorthand has been used from centuries as a cultural tool.
  <h4 class="headings">Machinery Shorthand</h4>
  A criteria of recording vocals in short codes by using machinery became started around 1906, when the Ward Stone invented stenotype machine in Ireland, He was an American stenographer and court reporter. Right now, the offices extended the uses of stentype and stenograph machines. But the stenographers are employed for conference and court reporting. Machines have both keyboards of 22 keys. Because the operator uses both thumbs and all fingers, any number of keys can be struck by operators  simultaneously. The roman language is printed by the machines on a strip of paper that automatically folds into the machine back. The keys operated by operator by touching and is thus able to watch the speaker. That prints the consonants occurring before vowels the fingers of the left hand control the keys. These keys print on the left side of the tape.The vowels are controlled by thumb, which are printed in the centre of the tape that shows the gap, the consonants that follow the vowels is the right hand , which are printed on the right side of the tape. For the English alphabet there are no seperate keys, thus, those letters for which there are no keys are represented by combinations of other letters. Abbreviations giving the operator the ability to write two or three words in one stroke.Shri vishwakarma institute is the one of the best fast growing institute in dera bassi and now which is also providing same other courses on computer educations like (CCC Course, C++ course, Typing courses,Basic computer courses etc). Many students from our institute has completed the test for courtroom stenographers and now selected and starts earning good money.in this time the basic computer knowledge is very necessary for any job.We also provides basic computer course and students who given 10th and +2 class examinations will surely do this course. Because this courses will covers in 3 months only and instead of roaming students should learn basic informations about computers also. <br>
  <br>
  <h4 class="headings">Stenotype Machine</h4>
  The stenographic method is most commonly used to transcribe proceedings. This is accomplished through the use of a stenotype machine. Unlike a computer keyboard, the machine uses multiple keys that can be pressed at once to record combinations of letters that represents sounds, words or phrases. In a process called computer-aided transcription (CAT), the symbols created by the stenotype machine are transcribed as text. Stenographers must maintain the computer dictionary that is used to translate keystroke codes or voice files. <br>
  <br>
  <h4 class="headings">Electronic Reporting</h4>
  A stenographer may use a method of court reporting called electronic reporting. Audio equipment is used to record court proceedings, and a stenographer monitors the process by taking notes, identifying speakers and listening to the recording to ensure that audio quality is maintained. <br>
  <br>
  <h4 class="headings">Voice Writing</h4>
  Another method of court reporting is voice writing. The stenographer speaks directly into a hand-held mask, which contains a microphone called a voice silencer. People in the courtroom cannot hear what is being said by the stenographer. This process also includes transcribing gestures and emotional reactions. The stenographer prepares a transcript of the court proceedings after the session is ended. <br>
  <br>
  <h4 class="headings">Education and Professional Requirements</h4>
  Stenographers typically need to earn a certificate or an associate's degree. Programs generally include coursework in legal terminology and English grammar, though the types of technology taught vary. Learning to use a stenotype machine generally requires more training than other methods.
  Graduates from a stenography or court reporting program often need to earn professional licensure or certification. Several states require individuals to hold the Registered Professional Reporter credential. <br>
  <br>
  <h4 class="headings">Career Information</h4>
  According to the Indian Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), graduates from a court reporting or stenography program can expect very good employment prospects. A 10% increase in employment of court reporters is expected in the 2012-2022 decade; this is an average growth rate. Stenographers who are familiar with Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART) or other captioning methods may have more opportunities. Also per the BLS, the average salary of court reporters was Rs 292,231 in 2019.
